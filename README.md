## Instructions
---
We strongly recommend that you come prepared with access to a computer that has the R and RStudio software installed. You can install R (version 4.1 or newer) by following this link - [Install R](https://cran.r-project.org/). Then you can install RStudio by following this link - [Install RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

The Markdown files can be found in the "scripts" folder along with the rendered (knitted) .html documents. Each topic has discussions about how to apply the statistical theory along with examples drawn from agricultural datasets - when possible. We have also included some helpful details on how to use the R/RStudio coding software/language.

To help prepare for the seminar you can review the Markdown files at your leisure and prepare questions. Furthermore, the seminars for each day will be recorded and shared with all registrants at the end of the seminar. If you have questions about any of the content, please feel free to email us (cfair13@uga.edu, or xuelin@uga.edu). We look forward to seeing you during the seminar.
