- [Install RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)  

The Markdown files can be found in the `scripts` folder along with the rendered (`.html`) documents. Each topic includes explanations of statistical theory with applied examples drawn from agricultural datasets. Guidance on using the R/RStudio environment is also provided.
